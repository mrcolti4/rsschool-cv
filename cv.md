### About me
I got acquainted with programming in 2019, then I just started my journey learning HTML and CSS from the book "The New Big Book of CSS" by David Sawyer McFarland and McFarland David. Having created a couple of simple websites, I realized that I wanted to create not just a layout, but something more and decided to learn a real programming language. I chose Python as my first language because it was on the rise. And later I got acquainted with his most popular framework - Django.

In these courses from rs school, I expect to advance in my knowledge of markup and Java Script language in order to become a professional developer later
